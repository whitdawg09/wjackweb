<p> Interests! </p>
<ul>Listening to music - I love listening to different types of music, but my favorite are Christian music and Taylor Swift. My favorite Christian songs are Surrounded, Another in the Fire, 10,000 reasons, Counting Every Blessing and Set a Fire. My favorite Taylor Swift songs are YOYOK, Wonderland, Haunted and The Last Great American Dynasty.</ul>

<ul>Reading Canterwood Crest - I have been reading the Canterwood Crest books for so long, and I reread them about once a year. There are 18 books, and half of them are about Sasha, and half are about Lauren.</ul>
