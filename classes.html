<ul>WEB - I have gotten really interested in programming and I like WEB because it helps me further my skills.</li> 
<ul>EP8 - EP is fun becuase we have learned so much about climate change and the enviornment and I can use that knowledge to help make a difference.</li>
<ul>Math - Mr. Graybeal is our math teacher and he is funny and makes class interesting.</li>
